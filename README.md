# Fancy TODO App

This repository contains a basic TODO App to showcase interaction between components and docker as simple "Glue-it-all-together" tool.

See [backend/README.md](backend/README.md) for the backend specifics and [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md) for -- well -- the frontend specifics.

To run the app, see each component individually.
